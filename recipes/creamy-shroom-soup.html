    <p>This creamy vegan soup is soon to be one of your go-to comfort soups for the cold weather. It's hearty, healthy, and delicious.</p>

    <p>I make this soup the second a hint of fall appears and it brings me so much joy.</p>

    <h5><strong>Ingredients</strong></h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>3/4 cup raw cashews</strong>, soaked overnight</li>
        <li><strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong></li>
        <li><strong>16 oz cremini mushrooms</strong>, sliced</li>
        <li><strong>1 yellow onion</strong>, diced</li>
        <li><strong>2 stalks celery</strong>, diced</li>
        <li><strong>2 medium carrots</strong>, diced</li>
        <li><strong>5 cloves garlic</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>3 sprigs fresh rosemary</strong></li>
        <li><strong>3 sprigs fresh thyme</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 tsb. flour</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1/2 cup dry white wine</strong></li>
        <li><strong>3/4 cup wild rice blend</strong></li>
        <li><strong>5-6 cups vegetable broth</strong></li>
    
    <h5>instructions</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend cashews with the water they soaked in until velvety smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large stock pot. Add in the celery, carrots, and onion and sauté over medium heat. Once soft, 8-10 minutes, add the garlic and sauté for another minute. If you have cooking twine, wrap the thyme and rosemary sprigs together. <em>If not, no worries it's just for ease of the stem removal later on.</em> Add the thyme and rosemary to the stock pot.</li>
        <li>Add the mushrooms and cook until medium brown and most of the liquids has been released, 12-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkly the mushrooms with flour and stir continuously for 2-3 minutes. Add the white wine and stir for another few minutes. Move on once thickened and bubbling.</li>
        <li>Add the wild rice and broth to the stock pot. Allow to cook for 45 minutes or until the ild rice starts to split open.</li>
        <li>Stir in the cashew cream and remove them stems of the thyme and rosemary. Season the soup to tase with salt and pepper. <em>optional: I like to add cumin and garam masala at this step to counter balance the cashew flavor.</em></li>
        <li>Serve up your soup and enjoy! This can be stored for up to 5 days in the fridge or frozen for months.</li>
    </ol>
